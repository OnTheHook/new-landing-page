## My process

I followed along with a tutorial from the freeCodeCamp YouTube page. This gave me insight into how experienced developers layout a website and the tools they use.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about responsive design. This challenge along with the tutorial was very instructive. I also learned a lot about media queries, SASS, positioning and how to problem solve when faced with challenges.

### Continued development

I want to focus on responsive layouts and creating my own designs in the future.
